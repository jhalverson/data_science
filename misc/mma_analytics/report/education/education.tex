\section{Education}

The UFC website provides information on each fighter such
as their professional MMA record, age and height. They also provide
information labeled as ``College'' and ``Degree''. If a fighter in the
UFC database is listed as having a degree
or college then we will consider them a college graduate.
Accordingly, out of the 1897 fighters, there are 186 college graduates.
The complete list of educational data is found in Table~\ref{ed_table}
in Appendix~\ref{appendix_education}.
In this section we look at UFC fights between a college graduate
and a fighter who did not graduate college. Is there an advantage
to higher education?

Let's first look at the percentage of fights with at least
one college graduate as shown in Fig.~\ref{fights_with_college_grad}.
A steady increase in
college graduates is seen until around 2011 when it begins to decline.
The curve reaches a maximum of 45\% in 2011. For our analysis in this
section, we will consider all fights in 2003 and beyond.

\end{figure}

Note that we excluded fights involving thirteen fighters who fought in the UFC
but are
not found in their database. We also ignored the five fights that resulted
in a draw.
Using the cutoff date stated above, there are 1059 fights between a college
graduate and a fighter who did not graduate college. We find
597 of these fights or 56.4\% were won by the college graduate.
If education was not a factor then the likelihood of observing
this outcome or more extreme outcomes is $p\sim10^{-5}$. This
suggests that education does play a role in determining the outcome
of a fight.

One may think that the UFC college graduates all attended well-known wrestling
schools. This does not appear to be the case as Table~\ref{ed_table} shows
a variety of schools and degrees.
