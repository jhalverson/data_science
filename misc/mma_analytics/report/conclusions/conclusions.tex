\section{Conclusions}

Models were created to predict fight outcomes. Simple rule-based models
were used to demonstrated the significant role played by
age, reach and stance in determining fight outcomes.
Using only the age and reach of the two fighters, we can predict
the outcomes with
56.8\% accuracy using a logistic regression model. When many additional
features such as win ratio,
significant strikes landed per minute and takedown defense were
added, our accuracy only improved to about 60\%. We argued that the explanation
for the limited improvement is that the
additional features are not well-established. That is,
in 70\% of all UFC fights at least one of the two fighters
had only three previous UFC fights or less. This means quantities such
as significant strikes landed per minute are not well-established
for such fighters. This poor sampling makes prediction difficult. One could try
to use data on the fighters before they fought in the UFC
but this beyond the scope of this work.
