\textbf{Summary} -- Here we analyze UFC data from 1993 through February 2017. We look at the effect
of age, reach, stance.

\section*{Introduction}

How as the data obtained? Why do this?

How was data obtained? See appendix See appendix.

Fightnomics, Dr. u.
To our knowledge Fightnomic is the most comprehesive study on MMA
data. Unfortunately, the book doesn't apply a single statistical test
to the data making it interpretation impossible.

Sample table of fighters.
Sample table of fights.

There have been 4068 UFC fights between UFC 1 and UFC 208. The number of fighters is 1641.
This includes all pay-per-views, fight night on FS1, Fox, Spike, Ultimate Fighter.

In several figures we only consider data after January 1, 2005. This is mostly
an arbitrary choice to be free from but is close to the take over by Zuffa. The unified rules where implemented

\section*{UFC Events}
