    "In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton et al. showed how to train a deep neural network to recognize hand written digits with top accuracy. This was the beginning of deep learning. TensorFlow is a library for training deep NN on distributed systems (GPU). Deep learning can beat other conventional models by a substantial amount for many important problems."

Once a ML model has been trained and proven, one can inspect the inner working and learn about how it works.

    "Keep in mind the clustering methods are still learning methods (there are just no labels). Visualization algorithms are an example of unsupervised learning because they learn groups and plot them close together, for instance. Association rule learning is part of UL.
