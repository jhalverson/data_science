Data Ingestion

Sqoop can be used to transfer data from a relational
database such as MySQL or Oracle into HDFS, Hive
or HBase. This is done by using MapReduce with only
a mapper, no reducer. Sqoop can learn the schema
from the relational database.

For streaming data, Flume can be used to handle
the data. The three components are source, channel,
and sink. There are several configuration files to
setup.
