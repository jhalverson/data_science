Big Data: A revolution that will transform â€¦

Introduction

Big Data is Messy

As we draw from more bigger sources, mistakes or inexactitude enter. But these mistakes are outweighed by the gain of having much, much more data. An example of this is a grammar checker of the old days.

Correlation

Big data allows us to find correlations that were not possible in the small data world. This means we are given the what but not the why. For instance, Walmart found that in the days leading up a hurricane, people tend to buy flashlights and pop tarts.

Implications

There is the data, the people who know what to do with it and then the
people how come up with ideas for what to do with big data.

== Risks ==

This chapter begins with a description of the first scence of Minority
Report (Spielberg) where a man is arrested for a thought crime. The
point is that with model that have been fit by big data, we can have
a good prediction. Such models are used by parole boards in determin-
whether to grant parole or not. A professor has a model to predict
the probability that a parole will be involved in a homocide (the
perp or the victim) with accuracy of 70%. Thus decisions are being made
about what is likely to happen instead of people's actual actions.


== Control ==

New institutions and specific jobs are needed combat the perils of big
data since certain groups are vulnerable. "Notice and consent" is an
old approach. Because the uses of big data tend to become clear after
the data is collected, a better approach is to have the users of the
data be responsible for it. There are two clear cases where trying to
anonymotize the data failed: AOL and NetFlix. FaceBook intentionally
blurs the data when releasing big data to such individuals can not be
identified.

Page 177: One concern is punishing people for crimes that they have yet
to commit. Such a practice attacks free will or human volition. Many
models are just black boxes because there are many predictors and models
can be complicated to begin with like neural nets. For instance, in the
case of predicting exploding pot holes in NYC, there were 106 predictors
in the first model. Note: The broad of directors serve the investors not
the management. Monopolies of big data must be avoided with antitrust.
