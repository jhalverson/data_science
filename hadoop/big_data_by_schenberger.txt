Big Data: A revolution that will transform â€¦

Introduction

Big Data is Messy

As we draw from more bigger sources, mistakes or inexactitude enter. But these mistakes are outweighed by the gain of having much, much more data. An example of this is a grammar checker of the old days.

Correlation

Big data allows us to find correlations that were not possible in the small data world. This means we are given the what but not the why. For instance, Walmart found that in the days leading up a hurricane, people tend to buy flashlights and pop tarts.

Implications

There is the data, the people who know what to do with it and then the
people how come up with ideas for what to do with big data.

This chapter begins with a description of the first scence of Minority
Report (Spielberg) where a man is arrested for a thought crime. The
point is that with model that have been fit by big data, we can have
a good prediction. Such models are used by parole boards in determin-
whether to grant parole or not. A professor has a model to predict
the probability that a parole will be involved in a homocide (the
perp or the victim) with accuracy of 70%. Thus decisions are being made
about what is likely to happen instead of people's actual actions.
