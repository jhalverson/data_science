Data and Goliath (2015)
Bruce Schneier


== Introduction ==

Cell phone location tracking can infer lots of information. The police can use it.
Popular data brokers are Acxiom, Corelogic, Recorded Future. Sense Networks used
to record lots of cell phone data and make dossiers or profiles to sell. The Ukraine
sent a text to people at a protest indicating that they knew their location.
"Acxiom provides the data foundation for the world's best marketers." 
Verint makes cell tracking systems. Cobham is able to ping a phone without the
user knowing (blind). Defentek claims to be able to locate and track any phone.

One surveillance firm, called Defentek, boasts on its web page that its Infiltrator
Global Real-Time Tracking System can “locate and track any phone number in the world.”
The Infiltrator System is “a strategic solution that infiltrates and is undetected
and unknown by the network, carrier, or the target,” the site says.

GPS is more accurate than cellular. Phone apps use GPS like Angry Birds. HelloSpy
is hidden cell phone app. "The only way to gauge your employees’ loyalty is by monitoring
their cell phones. Employees tend to overuse the work phones assigned to them."

The NSA can track cell phones that are turned off or they can turn on the mic and
listen even to just learn whether in a crowded city street or a quiet room.


== 1. Data as a byproduct of computing ==

Google says give us your data for a bunch of free stuff. Mass surveillance by both
government and coporations. In many ways data is a byproduct of computing. GPS
is accurate to about 16-27 feet while cell towers only 2000 ft.

One can identify a computer by the software it has on it including the version
and what is enabled, etc.

Cars, online, stores, cell phones, photos, EZ-pass, Uber, Nest, IoT and smart
applications, quantified self. 23andMe could sell your markers to an insurance
company in the future. Internet connected devices are expected to number around 30
billion by 2020. We interact unknowingly with hundreds of computers every day.
"Data is the exhaust of the information ago." In 2015, 76 exabytes/year passing through
the internet. 300 petabytes or $300 million for every phone call in US/year. In 2011
Max Schrems sued FB to get all the data they had on him. They sent a 1200-page PDF
document that contained everything he clicked on including his profile information.


== 2. Data as surveillance ==

Snowden revealed that the NSA was recording the metadata for every US phone call.
Metadata is more important than the data for big data projects. A Google search
reveals a tremendous amount about someone. "We know who you are, where you have
been. More or less what you're thinking (before you think it)."

Government and coporations are talking because data gathering is cheap and prevalent.
Lots of spy tools in SkyMall. Spring charges police $30/month for phone location info.

NSA was recording all voice calls in Afhganistan to anticipate improvised explosive
devices.

License plate scanners and face recognition. The plate scanners are used by traffic
cops for repossesion/divorce lawyers to show infidelity/PI's/auto theft. Vigilant
Solutions in Livermore, CA. Also for warrants. They do facial recognition with
350 vectors.

FBI has 52 million faces, some from driver's licenses. Facial recognition was used
at a concert in Boston.


== 3. Analyzing our data ==

Corporations are interested in our data for marketing. By storing lots of data we can
look into the past when a new target appears. NSA stores several databases including
all the phone conversations on Bermuda (MYSTIC). State of New York retains license
plate data for up to five years. This allows them to figure out where people have been.
AT&T hangs on to text messages for 7 years. NSA was doing 3-hop searches but were
told to only do 2-hops on phone metadata for one program.

Google searches all of your Gmail to better advertise toward you.

NSA looks for GPS interactions between the target and everybody else. They check for
tails of their overseas spies. It looks for phones that are turned off but then used
for a brief period and looks for the same behavior amount other phones. It also looks
where people turn their phone off and who else did that. Geofencing is the practice
of delivering ads based on a person's location. Placecast works with Starbucks, Kmart
and others to deliver targeted ads based on geo-loco data.

Mass surveillance is the most powerful when inferences drawn across multiple data sets
are made. Facial recognition will help this. If you buy an subway card with cash and
use it every time you are in NYC, soon there will be only one person who has visited
the city on those days and this can be found out by looking at airline data, etc.

CMU researchers used facial recognition to dynamically load info about people walking
toward the camera on campus using facebook profile images of people who claim to be at CMU.
Initiate Systems correlates data across multiple data sets. They sell to both corporations
and governments. FB is partnering with Acxiom and Epsilon to correlate online profile
with in-store purchases. ExactData provides mailing lists and leads on specific groups
of people who have been flagged for a certain interest or behavior like dating online or
suffer from depression.

Cases where correlating large data sets worked include catching the woman who was having
the affair with the CIA director. She did not email him using her home wifi network but
instead used hotels and other public networks. However, she was the only name that was
using all those networks (from the registration data). The interview subjects of Alfred
Kinsey were 97% identified. Hard to release de-anonymized big data.


== 4. The business of surveillance ==

A smartphone flash light app was sending geolocation data and user information to
advertisers even when people turned the feature off.

Cookie have gotten more advanced. Google analytics is used to track you on sites that use
this service. Blur is an online privacy company that wrote DoNotTrackMe which was a browser
plugin. It keeps your information private. Cookies are also installed into Adobe Flash.
Both FB and Google have relaxed their privacy policies over the years. Google combined
their apps in 2012 to presumably make it easier to create a profile to sell. Apple is one
of the best companies at not selling user data. It could take everything in iCloud if it
decided to.
