Machine learning models based on big data tend to be opaque and give results
which are impossible to interpret cleanly. That is, they have essentially
no explainability. In 2007 the schools in Washington DC were failing. A plan
was enacted to test the teachers and fired the lower performers. This would be
decided based on a ML model based on big data by the firm Mathematica. A fifth
grade teacher named Sarah Wysocki was fired despite having an excellent reptu-
tation. The author points out that it is very difficult to decide who is
a bad teacher since so much depends on the students. A class size of only 20-30
students leads to bad statistics. The fired teacher complained that beside the
model is such a mystery (black box), it is not clear why she was fired. Furth-
ermore, it was found that there were excessive erasure marks on the 4th grade
test sheets suggesting that the teachers were  changing the grades since the
new program granted $8000 to the top performing teachers. The teacher and 205
others remained fired.
