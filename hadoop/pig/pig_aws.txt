PIG is similar to Hive except that is allows for more
advanced transformations using a procedural language of
Pig Latin. The main data structure is a relation which
can be thought of as a SQL table. It is also known as
the outer bag. Bags are collections stored in a single
cell.

Here are the built-in functions:

When running the job it was failing with "Output directory already exists."

The reason for this was not that the output directory in the
job step sumbit form was not new. The problem was that I had
made the sentiment_analysis directory on HDFS. So the job
was failing at the very end when it tried to write the data.

Here is a successful command:

Arguments: pig-script --run-pig-script --args -f s3://piggyinputs/population.pig -p INPUT=s3://piggyinputs/ -p OUTPUT=s3://piggyoutputs/

To start grunt type pig at the command line. Grunt was only partially
working. It works most of the time with the dump command but
always fails with illustrate giving a 2017 error or " 


[hadoop@ip-172-31-7-232 ~]$ pig
grunt> raw = load 's3://piggyinputs/co-est2014-pop-data.csv' using PigStorage(',');
grunt> state_county_pop = foreach raw generate $5, $6, $7;
grunt> dump state_county_pop;
