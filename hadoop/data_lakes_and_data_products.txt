Data lakes are large data stores of both structured and unstructed data.
They consist of both streaming and static data. They are WORM systems
which is important for science and other tasks the data must not change.
Often a sanitized subset of the data is fed into a data warehouse where
SQL queries can then be used.

A data product is something that both depends on data and produces data
as a product. It uses machine learning because it must always be adapt-
ing.
