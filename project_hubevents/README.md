# HubEvents

What are you doing this Thursday evening? With all that is going on in Boston
it is easy to miss key events. What if you could search all the events going
on with one search. Presently, one must search EventBrite, MeetUp, all 63
academic institutions, museums and groups.

George Mokray has been manually compiling a list of interesting events going
on in the Boston/Cambridge area.

Currently, API's at EventBrite and MIT are being used. Scrapers have been
written for Boston University. RSS feed is used for the Harvard Gazette.

This work was presented at Data-Con on August 8, 2015 in Cambridge, MA.
