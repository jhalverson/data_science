Comedy / Thriller\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI SMELL A WIFE\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nby Tom Carrozza \\xc2\\xa9 2017\\nDirected by Jonathan Halverson\\nQuick Synopsis:\\nDoggy (Douglas) Pendergast snapped and killed his wife Peterine, but he has a bad shoulder and cannot dispose of the body. At a bar he finds a troubled loner named Puck Nubly, and brings him home to help him finish the job. Puck misreads the situation entirely and thinks this is love. Puck is ready to nest, and he moves in and does so - much to the added shock of Doggy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grown children Agatha and Vito. As suspicions fire up, Doggy decides to go Puck\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way - they are in love - because it is the perfect cover, and it is better to be gay\\n1\\n      \\n than a murderer. Things unravel quickly and the story ripples through their little town, Random Ash Falls, which frames an every widening circle of Striking Characters. This death effects everyone. A suicide note in Peterine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handwriting emerges, and Doggy is off the hook. What this exposes, however, is that Peterine was having an affair with her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s husband, Thorgolf. Peterine, dead but still in the story, wants Thorgolf to get the blame for her death, not Doggy, so she manipulates things from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe other side\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to get her way.\\nAnd so the saga churns.\\nSEASON 1. 10 Episodes EPISODE #1.\\nINT. KITCHY SUBURBAN BAR - Night\\nCAMERA CALMLY ROVES THROUGH A BUNCH OF NERDY SWINGERS, LOOKING PATHETIC AND RIDICULOUS AS THEY PLOT TO PICK EACH OTHER UP.\\nCAMERA comes to rest on DOGGY PENDERGAST, a pharmacist with a little bandage on his head, standing alone against a wall with a drink in his hand. HE appears to be fixated on something in the distance. CAMERA EXPLORES and eventually REVEALS DOGGY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S P.O.V.: Sitting alone at the bar with his back to the room is PUCK NUBLY in black leathery, completely out of place. HE smolderingly reeks of darkness. All the red flags are up.\\nSEVERAL DISSOLVES show DOGGY and PUCK from VARIOUS ANGLES. DOGGY finally makes his move, but very slowly.\\nDOGGY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S P.O.V.\\nHE is really looking PUCK over with lingering shots of his back, his arms, his legs.\\n2\\n REVERSE:\\nDOGGY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S mind is racing.\\nDOGGY finally gets a spot right next to PUCK at the bar and begins to chat him up. PUCK is moody and uninterested at first, but DOGGY manages to engage him in conversation. PUCK says HE drives a fuel truck but got laid off. When DOGGY reveals HE is a pharmacist at a hospital, something clicks. Puck explodes on him because he was in their psyche ward once, and HE carries a grudge. Somehow DOGGY smoothes it all over nicely for him then comes clean\\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nDOGGY Look, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get right to the point.\\nPUCK\\nWhat.\\nDOGGY You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a great back.\\nPUCK\\n... I do?\\nDOGGY\\nYeah. Strong legs and arms, too. I can\\nsee good anatomy from miles away. I got a bum shoulder. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lift stuff too well.\\nPUCK\\nSo?\\nDOGGY\\nI need someone like you. Just for a night,\\nsay. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a thousand bucks in it for you. Just come back to my place for a while, ok?\\nREACTION: PUCK weighs this out, then shrugs. PUCK\\n      Sure.\\nPUCK reaches for his leather backpack, gets off his stool, and they exit together.\\nAT DOGGY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S HOUSE, however, PUCK helps DOGGY dispose of the BODY OF HIS WIFE, PETERINE, which was left in a bath tub full of water. It is rather obvious that DOGGY killed her. PUCK doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care much. THEY roll her in a rug, and dump her off a bridge into Random Ash Falls successfully.\\n3\\n THE NEXT MORNING in DOGGY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S HOUSE\\nPUCK wakes up on the floor to blazing sunshine and chirping birds.\\nWIDE reveals DOGGY still sleeping on the couch.\\nPUCK EXPLORES HIS NEW SURROUNDINGS. HE studies the family photos on the wall. PUCK is somewhat reborn. HIS eyes come to rest on DOGGY and HE looks at him CLOSELY. HE has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfeelings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for him.\\nPUCK falls in love quickly with DOGGY. That was not DOGGY\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intent, but HE goes along with it for several very good reasons: needs more help, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good alibi - what the hell.\\nLater, PUCK helps DOGGY clean up the place when ELEANOR, an unwitting neighbor comes over, to return something to PETERINE and further EXPO spills out.\\nPUCK covers for DOGGY beautifully because HE thinks they are a couple, and this is true love.\\nPUCK steps into the role of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwife\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and lovingly takes over DOGGY and his house.\\nBUT - THE AWFUL MOMENT COMES.\\nDOORBELL RINGS. OFFICER YUN and SOME POLICEMEN come to break the bad news: They found PETERINE dead in the river.\\nDOGGY PERFORMS BRILLIANTLY. His acting is impeccable. HE crumbles, cries and asks a million questions.\\nACROSS THE ROOM: PUCK is crying too - but only because DOGGY is. DOGGY, of course, is faking it, but there is a TWIST.\\nPETERINE left a suicide note.\\nThis stuns DOGGY. - She was going to kill herself anyway???\\nYes. And that totally gets DOGGY off the hook. It all checks. SHE even indicated that it would be death by water, or something.\\nDOGGY stops crying. HE can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it. Was he so horrible as a husband?? Why would she want to kill herself???\\nSilently, and quite miffed, THE GHOST OF PETERINE enters through the front door, sopping wet and covered in weeds, crosses the room, and exits into the bathroom to clean herself up. The OTHERS do not see her.\\n4\\n EPISODE #2..\\nPUCK only owns a few things, but a VHS players and some tapes are among them. HE hooks up the TV, pops in a tape, and soon \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDEBBIE REYNOLDS WORK-OUT\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is playing in the screen.\\nWIDER: PUCK and DOGGY are on the floor doing the workout with Debbie Reynolds, Rose Marie, Shelley Winters and others. DOGGY enjoys it.\\nThis is interrupted when DOGGY\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grown children, VITO and AGATHA, enter in deep grief. They have both come home. Traditionally, VITO lives in the attic and AGATHA lives in the basement. Now that PETERINE has committed suicide by jumping off a bridge, there is great unrest in the house. Not only does DOGGY have to break the news, but HE introduces PUCK and his new life partner. A double whammy, HE doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hold back.\\n     \\n      \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\nVITO Dad, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not gay.\\nDOGGY Yeah, well, I am now.\\nQuietly OFFICER YUN visits the crime scene, looks over the bridge, etc. HE is joined by PETERINE in ghost form and tapping her chin as SHE thinks.. HE doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see her.\\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nPETERINE\\nWhatever you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re thinking is wrong. You\\ncouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t possibly guess what lead up to this. You can try if you want to, just make sure that you want to. It might be too much for one man, even if you are the law. You could walk away right now, and no one would ever think twice. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d let it slide by if\\nI were you, but if you choose to move f orward on this, be ready, things are going to go my way.\\n After a moment, OFFICER YUN gets a surge of confidence and seems to make a commitment to his idea. HE walks away a stronger man. PETERINE nods to herself.\\n5\\n PETERINE\\n      Ok, then.\\nPETERINE takes a deep breath, a prepares for war. (Secretly PETERINE has already forgiven DOGGY and does not want him to get caught.)\\n...\\nThe next one DOGGY must deal with is Peterine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s younger sister PAMELA and her Swedish husband THORGOLF. PAMELA is the one that found the note, but SHE got it too late and blames herself. THORGOLF begins to sob real tears and DOGGY comforts him. PUCK, seeing that, goes to PAMELA and comforts her - and THEY click nicely together right from the start. SHE likes PUCK very much. THE GHOST OF PETERINE sits in doing needlepoint, making snide comments that THEY don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear. PAMELA also is full of information that DOGGY did not know.\\n...\\nOFFICER YUN visits DOGGY at work (HE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a pharmacist at a hospital) to bring him the autopsy report. DOGGY collapses as HE hears that PETERINE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death could\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been caused by either drowning (there was water in her lungs) or blunt force trauma to the head (from the big rocks in the river). The minute OFFICE YUN leaves, however, DOGGY is fine.\\n...\\nVITO and AGATHA act out is different ways. It is too much for them. THEY EACH take a dark turn. VITO loved his mother deeply, but AGATHA did not. As PETERINE watches this, SHE has brilliant comebacks for each comment, but THEY can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear HER.\\n...\\nTHE FUNERAL is small and simple. A lot of STRANGE LOOKS are passed from person to person as THEY GRIEVE. OFFICER YUN attends and watches everyone else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior. DOGGY performs perfectly as the grieving husband. HE accepts comfort from OTHERS, and PUCK stands by his man.\\n...\\nAT HOME, there is another surprise. Though there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been some foreshadowing, PUCK has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cacting pregnant\\xe2\\x80\\x9d - a CHILD comes into their lives. A Native American 5 year old girl named STARLIGHT needs a home. PUCK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart melts. DOGGY gives in. THEY are building a new family together. STARLIGHT silently casts spells of peace and love directly from the Earth. SHE can transform situations.\\nSTARLIGHT can see PETERINE, and THEY become great pals.\\n6\\n EPISODE 3.\\nINT. BEDROOM - Night\\nDOGGY is sitting on the bed propped up by pillows, and is very agitated with PETERINE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suicide note in hand.\\nWIDER: PUCK is ironing a shirt for him nearby.\\nDOGGY\\n      I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe the unmitigated nerve. How\\n      dare she leave me and the kids like that.\\nPUCK hangs up the fresh shirt.    \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nPUCK\\n(softly)\\nWell, we both know she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave you\\nand the kids like that.\\nDOGGY\\nNo, but she was going to do it anyway.\\nAfter all I did for her.\\nPUCK Right. You even did that for her.\\nDOGGY It was so selfish of her.\\n     \\nPUCK picks up the note and looks it over.\\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nPUCK (holding the note)\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fabulous note, really. Full of imagery. Lots of passion. You can tell she meant it. Where did Pamela say she found this?\\nDOGGY\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Somewhere in their house.\\nPUCK\\nHmm. - Why would it be in their hose?\\n7\\n REACTION with MUSCIAL CHILL: DOGGY is struck by that. Why would PETERINE write a letter like that to THORGOLF?\\n...\\nAs if the earlier news was not enough, VITO and AGATHA now have to adjust to having a little sister suddenly. THEY treat STARLIGHT like a thing, at first, and make no effort to connect with her. SHE is superior to them in many ways.\\n...\\nELEANOR from next door comes over, heart in hand, offering to help any way SHE can. SHE is surprised, however, to see how quickly things have changed in that house.\\n...\\nDOGGY has a chance encounter with THORGOLF (maybe just sees him from afar)and looks at him with great suspicion now. Was PETERINE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suicide note to him???\\n...\\nVITO and AGATHA are sitting in a parked car talking and smoking pot with the radio on. PETERINE is in the back seat, doing needlepoint, and fumes with disapporoval. There is a sudden knock at the window with a blazing flashlight. It is OFFICER YUN and once VITO rolls down the window, their guilt is in the hair.\\nOFFICER YUN\\n      Hey. What are you two doing here?\\nThere is a clunky PAUSE\\nVITO       We like this song.\\nHE let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s them go, but THEY do say something accidentally that gets him thinking. ...\\nDOGGY and PUCK enroll STARLIGHT in kindergarden and come into formal contact with MISS TIPTANNER, a seemingly young and wholesome teacher. SHE leads a tawdry double life, however, and has collected a lot of secrets from her playmates in Random Ash Falls. SHE seems to know everyone.\\n...\\n8\\n OFFICER YUN and ELEANOR have a chance encounter. THEY\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve known each other for a long time, but the loss of PETERINE has brought them together, and a SPARK begins to glow between them. ELEANOR and OFFICER YUN look at DOGGY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S new life from her porch. THEY both begin to wonder.\\nEPISODE #4.\\nPUCK begins to make-over DOGGY, gradually turning HIM into a modern man, not a suburban dad. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s while PUCK is dying DOGGY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S hair in the kitchen that PAMELA arrives, slightly outraged that DOGGY had PETERINE cremated, mostly because their parents gifted them with a family burial plot many years earlier. DOGGY maintains that the two of them discussed it often and cremation is what PETERINE wanted. HE adds that SHE can still be buried in that plot - in ash form. PUCK diffuses PAMELA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tension with pleasantries, and even asks how the suicide note ended up in her house, then SHE begins to wonder about that too. Watching this PETERINE, once again, is armed with brilliant zingers for each comment but they go unheard.\\n...\\nPAMELA is in emotional overload. SHE has a minor car accident, but hits HER head hard on the steering wheel. This leads to:\\nPAMELA and PETERINE - THE SISTERS SCENE\\nSomwhat in a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvoid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdream\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a shouting match ensues when PAMELA yells at PETERINE for dying. PETERINE, the older sister, is adept at skirting many issues and clearly withholding something. This leaves PAMELA in a highly agitated state.\\nBack at the car accident, PAMELA opens her eyes and sees OFFICER YUN, who offers a kind smile. As SHE slowly regains her composure, PAMELA blurts out something incriminating - leaving OFFICER YUN stunned.\\n...\\nPUCK has marriage on his mind. Now that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legal, HE makes many secret moves to prepare for his wedding to DOGGY. And a wedding means PUCK will have to introduce DOGGY to his mother - a aged Shakespearian actress - IVY HARGROVE NUBLY. Hence the name \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPuck\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. SHE arrives, and is very much an enchantress to ALL. But soon SHE lapses into her personal tragedy, and covertly blames PUCK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birth from stopping her from reaching ultimate stardom. The rift grows.\\n...\\nDR. MACK TRAUT, a sensual therapist, gets DOGGY alone and sensually invites HIM to attend his Grief Group on Monday Nights.\\n9\\n      \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nDR. TRAUT\\nI lost my Bernadette six years ago and I\\nstill feel the pain every day.\\nDOGGY Yuck.-Imean-Oh,no.\\nDR. TRAUT\\nThink about it, ok? Mondays are a good\\nnight for it because it sets the tone for the rest of the week. It clears the air a little bit so you can get on with your life. Besides there will be a lot of people you already know there. You shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be alone at a time like this. - You are conspicuously absent.\\nDOGGY acts grief-stricken but HE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not. MISS TIPTANNER comes to collect DR. TRAUT and THEY leave together arm-in-arm.\\nThe minute HE is alone, DOGGY rolls his eyes.\\nDOGGY (not happy)\\n      Great. There go my Monday Nights. ...\\nA DINNER GOES HORRIBLY WRONG. PUCK has cooked a huge and wonderful meal and DOGGY, IVY, VITO, AGATHA and STARLIGHT are happily seated around the table. PUCK serves, but IVY has a dark moodswing and begins to berate PUCK harshly in front of the others. Eventually AGATHA takes STARLIGHT away from the table, and things get worse. IVY spills out a lot of ugly details about PUCK\\xe2\\x80\\x99S tragic past. This leaves PUCK exposed and vulnerable.\\n...\\nAfter IVY leaves, PUCK has a breakdown and confesses to DOGGY. Everything that SHE said or implied was true. PUCK was very troubled once. This only brings DOGGY closer.\\n     \\n     \\n     \\nPUCK\\nI guess you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never marry me now.\\nDOGGY\\nProbably not. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only because\\nI hate asparagus.\\n10\\n EPISODE #5.\\nPUCK somehow acquires another child, this time it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an infant boy named WILLARD. Everyone is fine with it, and PUCK is blissed-out like a new mother. HE is very good with babies. HIS life is flourishing.\\n...\\nDOGGY attends a grief counseling group with DR. TRAUT, and again performs brilliantly and believably - however, THE GHOSTS OF EACH STORY shows up behind the actual people in the group. PETERINE is also there, pacing and thinking. DOGGY doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see them, but HE does begin to think everyone in the session killed the person they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re grieving for. The sweetest people in town have a dark side. A weird gestalt is exposed. THE GHOSTS all look at each other with friendly but annoyed disgust.\\nOn the way out of the meeting, DOGGY bumps into his old friend SMACKERS who takes a photography class in the same building. SMACKERS, usually a clown, is having a very hard time accepting PETERINE\\xe2\\x80\\x99S death, and was too afraid to reach out to DOGGY and the Kids. When asked, DOGGY gives SMACKERS the complete summation without holding back now. HE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s living with a man now, the love of his life, and THEY two new kids in addition to the two old kids. SMACKERS is frozen with disbelief. In a rare move (to gain his allegiance) DOGGY invites SMACKERS and his wife SIMONE to dinner at their house. Still shocked, SMACKERS doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really answer but DOGGY takes it as a yes.\\nDOGGY\\n      You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be just like old times.\\nDOGGY walks away, leaving SMACKERS thunderstruck. ...\\nAT A CARNIVAL, THE NEW FAMILY OF 4 (DOGGY, PUCK, STARLIGHT and WILLARD) is out and having a wonderful time. DOGGY has to go to the mens room and peels off from the OTHERS. HE gets lost, however, and ends up in the presence of ALLONDRA THE GREAT - a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpsychic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. ! SHE seems to know \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceverything\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about HIM as well as his future. This shakes DOGGY to the bone. SHE gives him very good advice. DOGGY never mentions this to anyone, but HE starts behaving differently and PUCK notices. ALLONDRA becomes DOGGY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S elusive fixation. HE thinks HE sees HER in crowds, etc. HE needs more answers.\\n...\\n11\\n PUCK and AGATHA go through PETERINE\\xe2\\x80\\x99S things and PETERINE watches in horror. THEY are deciding to give away HER best stuff.\\n...\\nAt a bar OFFICER YUN has a very accidental run-in with DR. TRAUT and MISS TIPTANNER and is comedically flustered by being near DR. TRAUT, who is still and calm. Why HE has this direction is unexplained for now, but HE does glean some new info from DR. TRAUT.\\n...\\nVITO gets a death threat! Somebody knows something. It looks like danger is looming but the threat turns out to be from AGATHA, who is mad about something small.\\n...\\nENDS WITH THE DINNER PARTY.\\nPUCK loves to throw dinner parties.\\n4 Couples: DOGGY and PUCK, SMACKERS and SIMONE, PAMELA and THORGOLF, OFFICER YUN and ELEANOR. PETERINE is in attendance, too.\\nIt brings the evening to a boil. There is exceptional tension between PAMELA and THORGOLF, something has changed, and the OTHERS must adjust.\\nEPISODE #6.\\nPUCK pops in another VHS tape and this time it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSHIRLEY MacLAINE\\xe2\\x80\\x99S INNER WORKOUT\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in which she teaches about chakras. PUCK and DOGGY are sitting on the floor and deeply absorbing the information. THEY are in a highly spiritual state and slowly nod with insight.\\nAfter:\\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nDOGGY\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having a red chakra blockage.\\nPUCK Why? What? Tell me.\\nDOGGY\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to go to Traut\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grief group\\nanymore, and I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t brink myself to tell him. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just not me.\\n12\\n PUCK squares off DOGGY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S shoulders gently and looks directly at him.\\nPUCK\\n      This is good. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s breathe in some\\n      red right now. ...\\nDOGGY tells DR. TRAUT that HE will no longer attend his grief group. HE says it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all too fresh for him right now, and that HE might seeks a personal therapist. DR. TRAUT is eager to do the job, but DOGGY sidesteps his offer. DR. TRAUT also says the HE has connections in publishing, and that cases like this could make a very good book. DOGGY is disgusted.\\n...\\nPUCK accidentally meets THORGOLF in a supermarket and, in a very friendly way, interrogates him about PETERINE and her note. PUCK is a hero. HE gets THORGOLF in implicate several things.\\n...\\nDR. TRAUT is found Dead.\\nThere seems to be a KILLER on the lose. Another one.\\n(LATER: it turns out to be THORGOLF. HE was in love with PETERINE, and was somehow sure that DR. TRAUT leaked the information to PUCK and OTHERS. THE SUICIDE NOTE WAS REALLY TO THOROLF - not PAMELA.\\nSIMONE knew all about the affair but never said a word to her friend PAMELA. ...\\nVITO misses PETERINE painfully.\\nVITO picks a fight with PUCK in the kitchen.\\n     \\n     \\nVITO runs out.\\n...\\nVITO (shouting)\\nGet it through your stupid head! You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not my mother!\\nVITO overhears \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSOMEBODY IN TOWN\\xe2\\x80\\x9d say that DOGGY killed PETERINE and that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always the husband. This stings. VITO begins to have FLASHBACKS that support that theory.\\n13\\n ...\\nVITO approaches SMACKERS.\\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nVITO\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been going\\non in our house,. I know you were there the other night, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see what was really happening. I kind of want to form an intervention. A tiny one. Just maybe me, and you, and one other person. Would you do that for me? I just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t face my Dad alone about this.\\nSMACKERS (likes his idea)\\nYeah. Ok. Sure. - What have you got in mind?\\n...\\nThen VITO approaches THORGOLF.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nVITO\\nI know you might think this is weird, but\\nso much has been going on that I just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand. etc.\\nTHORGOLF is absolutely frozen with alarm as HE listens. VITO tells him that SMACKERS is already on board, and THORGOLF says yes.\\n...\\nSIMONE talks to ELEANOR. ELEANOR talks to OFFICER YUN. And suddenly DOGGY looks a little guilty.\\n...\\nThe Murder is visited again.\\nHE didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t kill HER out of jealousy or greed or spite. - SHE ruined his paid vacation (or something). The rage overtook him and HE beat PETERINE to death with a weird object. PETERINE, by chance, happens to end up face-down in a bathtub full of water, which would account for the water in her lungs in an autopsy.

HE divulges something very personal about PUCK that no one knew, and ELEANOR runs with it.\\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n...\\nPINEAPPLE HEAD\\nIf you see Puck, tell him a few of his john\\nhave been looking for him. ELEANOR\\nHis johns?\\nPINEAPPLE HEAD Yeah. His tricks. His regulars. A lot of\\nthem want to know where he is - especially the ones he owes money to.\\nAGATHA begins to clean up her act, and suddenly entertains ideas about God. That is CLYDE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s influence on HER, and HE is not sure that HE likes it. AGATHA and CLYDE switch places a little.\\n...\\nDOGGY and PUCK \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTRIPPING\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with PETERINE listening.\\nTHEY reflect on their relationship in a cosmic way that keeps getting more and more abstract, until THEY convince themselves that their souls must\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve met before they were born so that THEY could be together now. The fact that a murder had been committed in the process doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother them.\\n...\\nOFFICER YUN and MISS TIPTANNER begin to date as HE reads the dead DR. TRAUT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S notes. THEY are clearly using each other. Among the tidbits listed is that THORGOLF is a habitual liar.\\nBig shock: It turns out that DR. TRAUT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first wife was ALLONDRA THE GREAT, and THEY were only married for seven months.\\n...\\nTHORGOLF tries to kill himself in jail, but luckily is saved. PETERINE reprimands him, citing HE must be a lot more patient with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe process\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. PAMELA, however, wishes HE were dead.\\n...\\n31\\n DOGGY and PUCK watch that story on the news. Quietly, THEY can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help noting that would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been the perfect solution.\\nEPISODE #19.\\nDOGGY and PUCK invite RODNEY and ROSEMARY over to return \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat they found in the trunk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and they sheepishly confess: THEY\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been running drugs across the country and are always on the run. RODNEY, citing that DOGGY is a pharmacist, offers to cut him into some very lucrative deals that are in the works. THEY pour on the temptations very thickly, but DOGGY says no, joking that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s HE is already doing far more damage to people just by being a pharmacist.\\n...\\nELEANOR tells everyone PUCK used to be a hooker - starting with SIMONE so that the rumor will fly fast.\\n...\\nREVEREND DOVEDEAD sends CLYDE away forever. HE doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even get to say good-bye to AGATHA. PUCK tries to console HER.\\n...\\nSIMONE contacts PAMELA and tells her PUCK was a prostitute. SHE pushes the story very far, filling in details of her own design, like that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how HE really met DOGGY. PAMELA doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy any of it, and instead tells SIMONE off, adding SHE is no one to point a finger at OTHERS. This escalates quickly and dangerously.\\n...\\nDOGGY and PUCK process their evening with RODNEY and ROSEMARY, and their eagerness for his involvement. DOGGY flatly says HE doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need anything. HE has enough money, a family - well, two families, sort of - and crime is not for him.\\n...\\nMISS TIPTANNER moves on to REVEREND DOVEDEAD (SHE likes authority figures. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 3 for 3.) In so doing SHE cunningly opens a new line of communication that will get EVERYONE in trouble. She says someone stole DR. TRAUT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s notebooks. They could be anywhere.\\nThat sends a shockwave through the town, and REVEREND DOVEDEAD uses his full power to exploit the situation, comparing it to The Final Reckoning.\\n32\\n ...\\nTHE GRAND OPENING of CHANTILLY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S PIERCING SHOP\\nThe place is rockin\\xe2\\x80\\x99. DEAD CHARACTERS and PINEAPPLE HEAD are there, too.

PUCK maintains that it was so long ago that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count. But a wedge has appeared in their marriage and they have to work around it.\\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n    ...\\nDOGGY\\n  Why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you tell me you were a\\n  prostitute!\\nPUCK\\n  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a prostitute. Prostitutes have\\n  sex with strangers for money.\\nDOGGY\\n  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you were doing!\\nPUCK\\n  Well - they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t strangers for long\\nDOGGY\\n  Hoe much of it did you do?

HE does, however, have dirt on his newest customer ELEANOR: her house is about to be foreclosed. SHE blew all of her money. Instead of being vengeful, PUCK feels sorry for ELEANOR.\\n...\\nDOGGY and VITO have a man to man talk about marriage, which is secretly funny because DOGGY killed his wife.

Comedy / Thriller\\n\\u201cI SMELL A WIFE\\u201d\\nby Tom Carrozza \\xa9 2017\\nDirected by Jonathan Halverson\\nQuick Synopsis:\\nDoggy (Douglas) Pendergast snapped and killed his wife Peterine, but he has a bad shoulder and cannot dispose of the body. At a bar he finds a troubled loner named Puck Nubly, and brings him home to help him finish the job. Puck misreads the situation entirely and thinks this is love. Puck is ready to nest, and he moves in and does so - much to the added shock of Doggy\\u2019s grown children Agatha and Vito. As suspicions fire up, Doggy decides to go Puck\\u2019s way - they are in love - because it is the perfect cover, and it is better to be gay\\n1\\n      \\n than a murderer. Things unravel quickly and the story ripples through their little town, Random Ash Falls, which frames an every widening circle of Striking Characters. This death effects everyone. A suicide note in Peterine\\u2019s handwriting emerges, and Doggy is off the hook. What this exposes, however, is that Peterine was having an affair with her sister\\u2019s husband, Thorgolf. Peterine, dead but still in the story, wants Thorgolf to get the blame for her death, not Doggy, so she manipulates things from \\u201cthe other side\\u201d to get her way.\\nAnd so the saga churns.\\nSEASON 1. 10 Episodes EPISODE #1.\\nINT. KITCHY SUBURBAN BAR - Night\\nCAMERA CALMLY ROVES THROUGH A BUNCH OF NERDY SWINGERS, LOOKING PATHETIC AND RIDICULOUS AS THEY PLOT TO PICK EACH OTHER UP.\\nCAMERA comes to rest on DOGGY PENDERGAST, a pharmacist with a little bandage on his head, standing alone against a wall with a drink in his hand. HE appears to be fixated on something in the distance. CAMERA EXPLORES and eventually REVEALS DOGGY\\u2019S P.O.V.: Sitting alone at the bar with his back to the room is PUCK NUBLY in black leathery, completely out of place. HE smolderingly reeks of darkness. All the red flags are up.\\nSEVERAL DISSOLVES show DOGGY and PUCK from VARIOUS ANGLES. DOGGY finally makes his move, but very slowly.\\nDOGGY\\u2019S P.O.V.\\nHE is really looking PUCK over with lingering shots of his back, his arms, his legs.\\n2\\n REVERSE:\\nDOGGY\\u2019S mind is racing.\\nDOGGY finally gets a spot right next to PUCK at the bar and begins to chat him up. PUCK is moody and uninterested at first, but DOGGY manages to engage him in conversation. PUCK says HE drives a fuel truck but got laid off. When DOGGY reveals HE is a pharmacist at a hospital, something clicks. Puck explodes on him because he was in their psyche ward once, and HE carries a grudge. Somehow DOGGY smoothes it all over nicely for him then comes clean\\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nDOGGY Look, I\\u2019ll get right to the point.\\nPUCK\\nWhat.\\nDOGGY You\\u2019ve got a great back.\\nPUCK\\n... I do?\\nDOGGY\\nYeah. Strong legs and arms, too. I can\\nsee good anatomy from miles away. I got a bum shoulder. I can\\u2019t lift stuff too well.\\nPUCK\\nSo?\\nDOGGY\\nI need someone like you. Just for a night,\\nsay. There\\u2019s a thousand bucks in it for you. Just come back to my place for a while, ok?\\nREACTION: PUCK weighs this out, then shrugs. PUCK\\n      Sure.\\nPUCK reaches for his leather backpack, gets off his stool, and they exit together.\\nAT DOGGY\\u2019S HOUSE, however, PUCK helps DOGGY dispose of the BODY OF HIS WIFE, PETERINE, which was left in a bath tub full of water. It is rather obvious that DOGGY killed her. PUCK doesn\\u2019t care much. THEY roll her in a rug, and dump her off a bridge into Random Ash Falls successfully.\\n3\\n THE NEXT MORNING in DOGGY\\u2019S HOUSE\\nPUCK wakes up on the floor to blazing sunshine and chirping birds.\\nWIDE reveals DOGGY still sleeping on the couch.\\nPUCK EXPLORES HIS NEW SURROUNDINGS. HE studies the family photos on the wall. PUCK is somewhat reborn. HIS eyes come to rest on DOGGY and HE looks at him CLOSELY. HE has \\u201cfeelings\\u201d for him.\\nPUCK falls in love quickly with DOGGY. That was not DOGGY\\u2019s intent, but HE goes along with it for several very good reasons: needs more help, it\\u2019s a good alibi - what the hell.\\nLater, PUCK helps DOGGY clean up the place when ELEANOR, an unwitting neighbor comes over, to return something to PETERINE and further EXPO spills out.\\nPUCK covers for DOGGY beautifully because HE thinks they are a couple, and this is true love.\\nPUCK steps into the role of \\u201cwife\\u201d and lovingly takes over DOGGY and his house.\\nBUT - THE AWFUL MOMENT COMES.\\nDOORBELL RINGS. OFFICER YUN and SOME POLICEMEN come to break the bad news: They found PETERINE dead in the river.\\nDOGGY PERFORMS BRILLIANTLY. His acting is impeccable. HE crumbles, cries and asks a million questions.\\nACROSS THE ROOM: PUCK is crying too - but only because DOGGY is. DOGGY, of course, is faking it, but there is a TWIST.\\nPETERINE left a suicide note.\\nThis stuns DOGGY. - She was going to kill herself anyway???\\nYes. And that totally gets DOGGY off the hook. It all checks. SHE even indicated that it would be death by water, or something.\\nDOGGY stops crying. HE can\\u2019t believe it. Was he so horrible as a husband?? Why would she want to kill herself???\\nSilently, and quite miffed, THE GHOST OF PETERINE enters through the front door, sopping wet and covered in weeds, crosses the room, and exits into the bathroom to clean herself up. The OTHERS do not see her.\\n4\\n EPISODE #2..\\nPUCK only owns a few things, but a VHS players and some tapes are among them. HE hooks up the TV, pops in a tape, and soon \\u201cDEBBIE REYNOLDS WORK-OUT\\u201d is playing in the screen.\\nWIDER: PUCK and DOGGY are on the floor doing the workout with Debbie Reynolds, Rose Marie, Shelley Winters and others. DOGGY enjoys it.\\nThis is interrupted when DOGGY\\u2019s grown children, VITO and AGATHA, enter in deep grief. They have both come home. Traditionally, VITO lives in the attic and AGATHA lives in the basement. Now that PETERINE has committed suicide by jumping off a bridge, there is great unrest in the house. Not only does DOGGY have to break the news, but HE introduces PUCK and his new life partner. A double whammy, HE doesn\\u2019t hold back.\\n     \\n      \\u2022\\u2022\\u2022\\nVITO Dad, you\\u2019re not gay.\\nDOGGY Yeah, well, I am now.\\nQuietly OFFICER YUN visits the crime scene, looks over the bridge, etc. HE is joined by PETERINE in ghost form and tapping her chin as SHE thinks.. HE doesn\\u2019t see her.\\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nPETERINE\\nWhatever you\\u2019re thinking is wrong. You\\ncouldn\\u2019t possibly guess what lead up to this. You can try if you want to, just make sure that you want to. It might be too much for one man, even if you are the law. You could walk away right now, and no one would ever think twice. I\\u2019d let it slide by if\\nI were you, but if you choose to move f orward on this, be ready, things are going to go my way.\\n After a moment, OFFICER YUN gets a surge of confidence and seems to make a commitment to his idea. HE walks away a stronger man. PETERINE nods to herself.\\n5\\n PETERINE\\n      Ok, then.\\nPETERINE takes a deep breath, a prepares for war. (Secretly PETERINE has already forgiven DOGGY and does not want him to get caught.)\\n...\\nThe next one DOGGY must deal with is Peterine\\u2019s younger sister PAMELA and her Swedish husband THORGOLF. PAMELA is the one that found the note, but SHE got it too late and blames herself. THORGOLF begins to sob real tears and DOGGY comforts him. PUCK, seeing that, goes to PAMELA and comforts her - and THEY click nicely together right from the start. SHE likes PUCK very much. THE GHOST OF PETERINE sits in doing needlepoint, making snide comments that THEY don\\u2019t hear. PAMELA also is full of information that DOGGY did not know.\\n...\\nOFFICER YUN visits DOGGY at work (HE\\u2019s a pharmacist at a hospital) to bring him the autopsy report. DOGGY collapses as HE hears that PETERINE\\u2019s death could\\u2019ve been caused by either drowning (there was water in her lungs) or blunt force trauma to the head (from the big rocks in the river). The minute OFFICE YUN leaves, however, DOGGY is fine.\\n...\\nVITO and AGATHA act out is different ways. It is too much for them. THEY EACH take a dark turn. VITO loved his mother deeply, but AGATHA did not. As PETERINE watches this, SHE has brilliant comebacks for each comment, but THEY can\\u2019t hear HER.\\n...\\nTHE FUNERAL is small and simple. A lot of STRANGE LOOKS are passed from person to person as THEY GRIEVE. OFFICER YUN attends and watches everyone else\\u2019s behavior. DOGGY performs perfectly as the grieving husband. HE accepts comfort from OTHERS, and PUCK stands by his man.\\n...\\nAT HOME, there is another surprise. Though there\\u2019s been some foreshadowing, PUCK has been \\u201cacting pregnant\\u201d - a CHILD comes into their lives. A Native American 5 year old girl named STARLIGHT needs a home. PUCK\\u2019s heart melts. DOGGY gives in. THEY are building a new family together. STARLIGHT silently casts spells of peace and love directly from the Earth. SHE can transform situations.\\nSTARLIGHT can see PETERINE, and THEY become great pals.\\n6\\n EPISODE 3.\\nINT. BEDROOM - Night\\nDOGGY is sitting on the bed propped up by pillows, and is very agitated with PETERINE\\u2019s suicide note in hand.\\nWIDER: PUCK is ironing a shirt for him nearby.\\nDOGGY\\n      I can\\u2019t believe the unmitigated nerve. How\\n      dare she leave me and the kids like that.\\nPUCK hangs up the fresh shirt.    \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nPUCK\\n(softly)\\nWell, we both know she didn\\u2019t leave you\\nand the kids like that.\\nDOGGY\\nNo, but she was going to do it anyway.\\nAfter all I did for her.\\nPUCK Right. You even did that for her.\\nDOGGY It was so selfish of her.\\n     \\nPUCK picks up the note and looks it over.\\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nPUCK (holding the note)\\nIt\\u2019s a fabulous note, really. Full of imagery. Lots of passion. You can tell she meant it. Where did Pamela say she found this?\\nDOGGY\\nI don\\u2019t know. Somewhere in their house.\\nPUCK\\nHmm. - Why would it be in their hose?\\n7\\n REACTION with MUSCIAL CHILL: DOGGY is struck by that. Why would PETERINE write a letter like that to THORGOLF?\\n...\\nAs if the earlier news was not enough, VITO and AGATHA now have to adjust to having a little sister suddenly. THEY treat STARLIGHT like a thing, at first, and make no effort to connect with her. SHE is superior to them in many ways.\\n...\\nELEANOR from next door comes over, heart in hand, offering to help any way SHE can. SHE is surprised, however, to see how quickly things have changed in that house.\\n...\\nDOGGY has a chance encounter with THORGOLF (maybe just sees him from afar)and looks at him with great suspicion now. Was PETERINE\\u2019s suicide note to him???\\n...\\nVITO and AGATHA are sitting in a parked car talking and smoking pot with the radio on. PETERINE is in the back seat, doing needlepoint, and fumes with disapporoval. There is a sudden knock at the window with a blazing flashlight. It is OFFICER YUN and once VITO rolls down the window, their guilt is in the hair.\\nOFFICER YUN\\n      Hey. What are you two doing here?\\nThere is a clunky PAUSE\\nVITO       We like this song.\\nHE let\\u2019s them go, but THEY do say something accidentally that gets him thinking. ...\\nDOGGY and PUCK enroll STARLIGHT in kindergarden and come into formal contact with MISS TIPTANNER, a seemingly young and wholesome teacher. SHE leads a tawdry double life, however, and has collected a lot of secrets from her playmates in Random Ash Falls. SHE seems to know everyone.\\n...\\n8\\n OFFICER YUN and ELEANOR have a chance encounter. THEY\\u2019ve known each other for a long time, but the loss of PETERINE has brought them together, and a SPARK begins to glow between them. ELEANOR and OFFICER YUN look at DOGGY\\u2019S new life from her porch. THEY both begin to wonder.\\nEPISODE #4.\\nPUCK begins to make-over DOGGY, gradually turning HIM into a modern man, not a suburban dad. It\\u2019s while PUCK is dying DOGGY\\u2019S hair in the kitchen that PAMELA arrives, slightly outraged that DOGGY had PETERINE cremated, mostly because their parents gifted them with a family burial plot many years earlier. DOGGY maintains that the two of them discussed it often and cremation is what PETERINE wanted. HE adds that SHE can still be buried in that plot - in ash form. PUCK diffuses PAMELA\\u2019s tension with pleasantries, and even asks how the suicide note ended up in her house, then SHE begins to wonder about that too. Watching this PETERINE, once again, is armed with brilliant zingers for each comment but they go unheard.\\n...\\nPAMELA is in emotional overload. SHE has a minor car accident, but hits HER head hard on the steering wheel. This leads to:\\nPAMELA and PETERINE - THE SISTERS SCENE\\nSomwhat in a \\u201cvoid\\u201d or \\u201cdream\\u201d a shouting match ensues when PAMELA yells at PETERINE for dying. PETERINE, the older sister, is adept at skirting many issues and clearly withholding something. This leaves PAMELA in a highly agitated state.\\nBack at the car accident, PAMELA opens her eyes and sees OFFICER YUN, who offers a kind smile. As SHE slowly regains her composure, PAMELA blurts out something incriminating - leaving OFFICER YUN stunned.\\n...\\nPUCK has marriage on his mind. Now that it\\u2019s legal, HE makes many secret moves to prepare for his wedding to DOGGY. And a wedding means PUCK will have to introduce DOGGY to his mother - a aged Shakespearian actress - IVY HARGROVE NUBLY. Hence the name \\u201cPuck\\u201d. SHE arrives, and is very much an enchantress to ALL. But soon SHE lapses into her personal tragedy, and covertly blames PUCK\\u2019s birth from stopping her from reaching ultimate stardom. The rift grows.\\n...\\nDR. MACK TRAUT, a sensual therapist, gets DOGGY alone and sensually invites HIM to attend his Grief Group on Monday Nights.\\n9\\n      \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nDR. TRAUT\\nI lost my Bernadette six years ago and I\\nstill feel the pain every day.\\nDOGGY Yuck.-Imean-Oh,no.\\nDR. TRAUT\\nThink about it, ok? Mondays are a good\\nnight for it because it sets the tone for the rest of the week. It clears the air a little bit so you can get on with your life. Besides there will be a lot of people you already know there. You shouldn\\u2019t be alone at a time like this. - You are conspicuously absent.\\nDOGGY acts grief-stricken but HE\\u2019s not. MISS TIPTANNER comes to collect DR. TRAUT and THEY leave together arm-in-arm.\\nThe minute HE is alone, DOGGY rolls his eyes.\\nDOGGY (not happy)\\n      Great. There go my Monday Nights. ...\\nA DINNER GOES HORRIBLY WRONG. PUCK has cooked a huge and wonderful meal and DOGGY, IVY, VITO, AGATHA and STARLIGHT are happily seated around the table. PUCK serves, but IVY has a dark moodswing and begins to berate PUCK harshly in front of the others. Eventually AGATHA takes STARLIGHT away from the table, and things get worse. IVY spills out a lot of ugly details about PUCK\\u2019S tragic past. This leaves PUCK exposed and vulnerable.\\n...\\nAfter IVY leaves, PUCK has a breakdown and confesses to DOGGY. Everything that SHE said or implied was true. PUCK was very troubled once. This only brings DOGGY closer.\\n     \\n     \\n     \\nPUCK\\nI guess you\\u2019ll never marry me now.\\nDOGGY\\nProbably not. But that\\u2019s only because\\nI hate asparagus.\\n10\\n EPISODE #5.\\nPUCK somehow acquires another child, this time it\\u2019s an infant boy named WILLARD. Everyone is fine with it, and PUCK is blissed-out like a new mother. HE is very good with babies. HIS life is flourishing.\\n...\\nDOGGY attends a grief counseling group with DR. TRAUT, and again performs brilliantly and believably - however, THE GHOSTS OF EACH STORY shows up behind the actual people in the group. PETERINE is also there, pacing and thinking. DOGGY doesn\\u2019t see them, but HE does begin to think everyone in the session killed the person they\\u2019re grieving for. The sweetest people in town have a dark side. A weird gestalt is exposed. THE GHOSTS all look at each other with friendly but annoyed disgust.\\nOn the way out of the meeting, DOGGY bumps into his old friend SMACKERS who takes a photography class in the same building. SMACKERS, usually a clown, is having a very hard time accepting PETERINE\\u2019S death, and was too afraid to reach out to DOGGY and the Kids. When asked, DOGGY gives SMACKERS the complete summation without holding back now. HE\\u2019s living with a man now, the love of his life, and THEY two new kids in addition to the two old kids. SMACKERS is frozen with disbelief. In a rare move (to gain his allegiance) DOGGY invites SMACKERS and his wife SIMONE to dinner at their house. Still shocked, SMACKERS doesn\\u2019t really answer but DOGGY takes it as a yes.\\nDOGGY\\n      You\\u2019ll see.

SHE seems to know \\u201ceverything\\u201d about HIM as well as his future. This shakes DOGGY to the bone. SHE gives him very good advice. DOGGY never mentions this to anyone, but HE starts behaving differently and PUCK notices. ALLONDRA becomes DOGGY\\u2019S elusive fixation. HE thinks HE sees HER in crowds, etc. HE needs more answers.\\n...\\n11\\n PUCK and AGATHA go through PETERINE\\u2019S things and PETERINE watches in horror. THEY are deciding to give away HER best stuff.\\n...\\nAt a bar OFFICER YUN has a very accidental run-in with DR. TRAUT and MISS TIPTANNER and is comedically flustered by being near DR.

Tell me.\\nDOGGY\\nI don\\u2019t want to go to Traut\\u2019s grief group\\nanymore, and I can\\u2019t brink myself to tell him.

Let\\u2019s breathe in some\\n      red right now. ...\\nDOGGY tells DR. TRAUT that HE will no longer attend his grief group. HE says it\\u2019s all too fresh for him right now, and that HE might seeks a personal therapist. DR. TRAUT is eager to do the job, but DOGGY sidesteps his offer. DR. TRAUT also says the HE has connections in publishing, and that cases like this could make a very good book.

HE gets THORGOLF in implicate several things.\\n...\\nDR. TRAUT is found Dead.\\nThere seems to be a KILLER on the lose. Another one.\\n(LATER: it turns out to be THORGOLF. HE was in love with PETERINE, and was somehow sure that DR. TRAUT leaked the information to PUCK and OTHERS. THE SUICIDE NOTE WAS REALLY TO THOROLF - not PAMELA.\\nSIMONE knew all about the affair but never said a word to her friend PAMELA. ...\\nVITO misses PETERINE painfully.\\nVITO picks a fight with PUCK in the kitchen.\\n     \\n     \\nVITO runs out.\\n...\\nVITO (shouting)\\nGet it through your stupid head! You\\u2019re not my mother!\\nVITO overhears \\u201cSOMEBODY IN TOWN\\u201d say that DOGGY killed PETERINE and that it\\u2019s always the husband. This stings.

Just maybe me, and you, and one other person. Would you do that for me? I just can\\u2019t face my Dad alone about this.\\nSMACKERS (likes his idea)\\nYeah. Ok. Sure. - What have you got in mind?\\n...\\nThen VITO approaches THORGOLF.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\nVITO\\nI know you might think this is weird, but\\nso much has been going on that I just don\\u2019t understand. etc.\\nTHORGOLF is absolutely frozen with alarm as HE listens. VITO tells him that SMACKERS is already on board, and THORGOLF says yes.\\n...\\nSIMONE talks to ELEANOR. ELEANOR talks to OFFICER YUN. And suddenly DOGGY looks a little guilty.\\n...\\nThe Murder is visited again.\\nHE didn\\u2019t kill HER out of jealousy or greed or spite. - SHE ruined his paid vacation (or something). The rage overtook him and HE beat PETERINE to death with a weird object. PETERINE, by chance, happens to end up face-down in a bathtub full of water, which would account for the water in her lungs in an autopsy. Then DOGGY cleaned himself up, went to the BAR to look for someone strong to help him dispose of the body, and that turned out to be PUCK.\\n...\\n14\\n OFFICER YUN appears. HE asks DOGGY to come in for \\u201ca few questions\\u201d.\\nEPISODE #7.\\nIn an interrogation room, DOGGY is questioned about PETERINE\\u2019S death.

THORGOLF\\u2019S P.O.V. reveals HE has singled out DOGGY to kill next. DOGGY was the one thing standing between PETERINE and him. Things shift in a surprising way.

DOGGY prays over him. Looks grim. There is the slight flurry of POLICE and MEDICAL activity in the distance.\\n16\\n \\n ...\\nVery dramatically THORGOLF is taken into custody, and with that his lawyer IRVING DINKLE is introduced. HE is polite and gentle, and possibly not skilled enough to defend THORGOLF, but THEY go way back. In fact, IRVING knew DOGGY in the past, too. PETERINE is thrilled by HIS incarceration. SHE\\u2019s got HIM now.\\n...\\nIn the HOSPITAL CHAPEL: DOGGY sits sadly alone, totally lost. The two-faced REVEREND DOVEDEAD slips into the pew behind him.

HE is non-other than STOVE NUBLY, the now-aged drummer from the rock band SHAT. STOVE is now a cinder of a man, but HE is also the mirror image of PUCK\\u2019s dark side. The resemblance is overwhelming. PAMELA acts as a go-between and fills in the blanks for IVY and STOVE.\\nPUCK emerges from the coma but is still in a very weak state, but HE manages to convey a \\u201cOh God, not him\\u201d vibe when HE sees STOVE..

       "' TOM CARROZZA 329 W. 21st St., #1F, NYC (917) 553-0509 Zestytomato@aol.com TREATMENT: 1-hour series. Comedy / Thriller I SMELL A WIFE by Tom Carrozza  2017 Directed by Jonathan Halverson Quick Synopsis: Doggy (Douglas) Pendergast snapped and killed his wife Peterine, but he has a bad shoulder and cannot dispose of the body. At a bar he finds a troubled loner named Puck Nubly, and brings him home to help him finish the job. Puck misreads the situation entirely and thinks this is love. Puck is ready to nest, and he moves in and does so - much to the added shock of Doggys grown children Agatha and Vito. As suspicions fire up, Doggy decides to go Pucks way - they are in love - because it is the perfect cover, and it is better to be gay 1         than a murderer. Things unravel quickly and the story ripples through their little town, Random Ash Falls, which frames an every widening circle of Striking Characters. This death effects everyone. A suicide note in Peterines handwriting emerges, and Doggy is off the hook. What this exposes, however, is that Peterine was having an affair with her sisters husband, Thorgolf. Peterine, dead but still in the story, wants Thorgolf to get the blame for her death, not Doggy, so she manipulates things from the other side to get her way. And so the saga churns. SEASON 1. 10 Episodes EPISODE #1. INT. KITCHY SUBURBAN BAR - Night CAMERA CALMLY ROVES THROUGH A BUNCH OF NERDY SWINGERS, LOOKING PATHETIC AND RIDICULOUS AS THEY PLOT TO PICK EACH OTHER UP. CAMERA comes to rest on DOGGY PENDERGAST, a pharmacist with a little bandage on his head, standing alone against a wall with a drink in his hand. HE appears to be fixated on something in the distance. CAMERA EXPLORES and eventually REVEALS DOGGYS P.O.V.: Sitting alone at the bar with his back to the room is PUCK NUBLY in black leathery, completely out of place. HE smolderingly reeks of darkness. All the red flags are up. SEVERAL DISSOLVES show DOGGY and PUCK from VARIOUS ANGLES. DOGGY finally makes his move, but very slowly. DOGGYS P.O.V. HE is really looking PUCK over with lingering shots of his back, his arms, his legs. 2  REVERSE: DOGGYS mind is racing. DOGGY finally gets a spot right next to PUCK at the bar and begins to chat him up. PUCK is moody and uninterested at first, but DOGGY manages to engage him in conversation. PUCK says HE drives a fuel truck but got laid off. When DOGGY reveals HE is a pharmacist at a hospital, something clicks. Puck explodes on him because he was in their psyche ward once, and HE carries a grudge. Somehow DOGGY smoothes it all over nicely for him then comes clean                                                                         DOGGY Look, Ill get right to the point. PUCK What. DOGGY Youve got a great back. PUCK ... I do? DOGGY Yeah. Strong legs and arms, too. I can see good anatomy from miles away. I got a bum shoulder. I cant lift stuff too well. PUCK So? DOGGY I need someone like you. Just for a night, say. Theres a thousand bucks in it for you. Just come back to my place for a while, ok? REACTION: PUCK weighs this out, then shrugs. PUCK       Sure. PUCK reaches for his leather backpack, gets off his stool, and they exit together. AT DOGGYS HOUSE, however, PUCK helps DOGGY dispose of the BODY OF HIS WIFE, PETERINE, which was left in a bath tub full of water. It is rather obvious that DOGGY killed her. PUCK doesnt care much. THEY roll her in a rug, and dump her off a bridge into Random Ash Falls successfully. 3  THE NEXT MORNING in DOGGYS HOUSE PUCK wakes up on the floor to blazing sunshine and chirping birds. WIDE reveals DOGGY still sleeping on the couch. PUCK EXPLORES HIS NEW SURROUNDINGS. HE studies the family photos on the wall. PUCK is somewhat reborn. HIS eyes come to rest on DOGGY and HE looks at him CLOSELY. HE has feelings for him. PUCK falls in love quickly with DOGGY. That was not DOGGYs intent, but HE goes along with it for several very good reasons: needs more help, its a good alibi - what the hell. Later, PUCK helps DOGGY clean up the place when ELEANOR, an unwitting neighbor comes over, to return something to PETERINE and further EXPO spills out. PUCK covers for DOGGY beautifully because HE thinks they are a couple, and this is true love. PUCK steps into the role of wife and lovingly takes over DOGGY and his house. BUT - THE AWFUL MOMENT COMES. DOORBELL RINGS. OFFICER YUN and SOME POLICEMEN come to break the bad news: They found PETERINE dead in the river. DOGGY PERFORMS BRILLIANTLY. His acting is impeccable. HE crumbles, cries and asks a million questions. ACROSS THE ROOM: PUCK is crying too - but only because DOGGY is. DOGGY, of course, is faking it, but there is a TWIST. PETERINE left a suicide note. This stuns DOGGY. - She was going to kill herself anyway??? Yes. And that totally gets DOGGY off the hook. It all checks. SHE even indicated that it would be death by water, or something. DOGGY stops crying. HE cant believe it. Was he so horrible as a husband?? Why would she want to kill herself??? Silently, and quite miffed, THE GHOST OF PETERINE enters through the front door, sopping wet and covered in weeds, crosses the room, and exits into the bathroom to clean herself up. The OTHERS do not see her. 4  EPISODE #2.. PUCK only owns a few things, but a VHS players and some tapes are among them. HE hooks up the TV, pops in a tape, and soon DEBBIE REYNOLDS WORK-OUT is playing in the screen. WIDER: PUCK and DOGGY are on the floor doing the workout with Debbie Reynolds, Rose Marie, Shelley Winters and others. DOGGY enjoys it. This is interrupted when DOGGYs grown children, VITO and AGATHA, enter in deep grief. They have both come home. Traditionally, VITO lives in the attic and AGATHA lives in the basement. Now that PETERINE has committed suicide by jumping off a bridge, there is great unrest in the house. Not only does DOGGY have to break the news, but HE introduces PUCK and his new life partner. A double whammy, HE doesnt hold back.              VITO Dad, youre not gay. DOGGY Yeah, well, I am now. Quietly OFFICER YUN visits the crime scene, looks over the bridge, etc. HE is joined by PETERINE in ghost form and tapping her chin as SHE thinks.. HE doesnt see her.                                                             PETERINE Whatever youre thinking is wrong. You couldnt possibly guess what lead up to this. You can try if you want to, just make sure that you want to. It might be too much for one man, even if you are the law. You could walk away right now, and no one would ever think twice. Id let it slide by if I were you, but if you choose to move f orward on this, be ready, things are going to go my way.  After a moment, OFFICER YUN gets a surge of confidence and seems to make a commitment to his idea. HE walks away a stronger man. PETERINE nods to herself. 5  PETERINE       Ok, then. PETERINE takes a deep breath, a prepares for war. (Secretly PETERINE has already forgiven DOGGY and does not want him to get caught.) ... The next one DOGGY must deal with is Peterines younger sister PAMELA and her Swedish husband THORGOLF. PAMELA is the one that found the note, but SHE got it too late and blames herself. THORGOLF begins to sob real tears and DOGGY comforts him. PUCK, seeing that, goes to PAMELA and comforts her - and THEY click nicely together right from the start. SHE likes PUCK very much. THE GHOST OF PETERINE sits in doing needlepoint, making snide comments that THEY dont hear. PAMELA also is full of information that DOGGY did not know. ... OFFICER YUN visits DOGGY at work (HEs a pharmacist at a hospital) to bring him the autopsy report. DOGGY collapses as HE hears that PETERINEs death couldve been caused by either drowning (there was water in her lungs) or blunt force trauma to the head (from the big rocks in the river). The minute OFFICE YUN leaves, however, DOGGY is fine. ... VITO and AGATHA act out is different ways. It is too much for them. THEY EACH take a dark turn. VITO loved his mother deeply, but AGATHA did not. As PETERINE watches this, SHE has brilliant comebacks for each comment, but THEY cant hear HER. ... THE FUNERAL is small and simple. A lot of STRANGE LOOKS are passed from person to person as THEY GRIEVE. OFFICER YUN attends and watches everyone elses behavior. DOGGY performs perfectly as the grieving husband. HE accepts comfort from OTHERS, and PUCK stands by his man. ... AT HOME, there is another surprise. Though theres been some foreshadowing, PUCK has been acting pregnant - a CHILD comes into their lives. A Native American 5 year old girl named STARLIGHT needs a home. PUCKs heart melts. DOGGY gives in. THEY are building a new family together. STARLIGHT silently casts spells of peace and love directly from the Earth. SHE can transform situations. STARLIGHT can see PETERINE, and THEY become great pals. 6  EPISODE 3. INT. BEDROOM - Night DOGGY is sitting on the bed propped up by pillows, and is very agitated with PETERINEs suicide note in hand. WIDER: PUCK is ironing a shirt for him nearby. DOGGY       I cant believe the unmitigated nerve. How       dare she leave me and the kids like that. PUCK hangs up the fresh shirt.                                   PUCK (softly) Well, we both know she didnt leave you and the kids like that. DOGGY No, but she was going to do it anyway. After all I did for her. PUCK Right. You even did that for her. DOGGY It was so selfish of her.       PUCK picks up the note and looks it over.                               PUCK (holding the note) Its a fabulous note, really. Full of imagery. Lots of passion. You can tell she meant it. Where did Pamela say she found this? DOGGY I dont know. Somewhere in their house. PUCK Hmm. - Why would it be in their hose? 7  REACTION with MUSCIAL CHILL: DOGGY is struck by that. Why would PETERINE write a letter like that to THORGOLF? ... As if the earlier news was not enough, VITO and AGATHA now have to adjust to having a little sister suddenly. THEY treat STARLIGHT like a thing, at first, and make no effort to connect with her. SHE is superior to them in many ways. ... ELEANOR from next door comes over, heart in hand, offering to help any way SHE can. SHE is surprised, however, to see how quickly things have changed in that house. ... DOGGY has a chance encounter with THORGOLF (maybe just sees him from afar)and looks at him with great suspicion now. Was PETERINEs suicide note to him??? ... VITO and AGATHA are sitting in a parked car talking and smoking pot with the radio on. PETERINE is in the back seat, doing needlepoint, and fumes with disapporoval. There is a sudden knock at the window with a blazing flashlight. It is OFFICER YUN and once VITO rolls down the window, their guilt is in the hair. OFFICER YUN       Hey. What are you two doing here? There is a clunky PAUSE VITO       We like this song. HE lets them go, but THEY do say something accidentally that gets him thinking. ... DOGGY and PUCK enroll STARLIGHT in kindergarden and come into formal contact with MISS TIPTANNER, a seemingly young and wholesome teacher. SHE leads a tawdry double life, however, and has collected a lot of secrets from her playmates in Random Ash Falls. SHE seems to know everyone. ... 8  OFFICER YUN and ELEANOR have a chance encounter. THEYve known each other for a long time, but the loss of PETERINE has brought them together, and a SPARK begins to glow between them. ELEANOR and OFFICER YUN look at DOGGYS new life from her porch. THEY both begin to wonder. EPISODE #4. PUCK begins to make-over DOGGY, gradually turning HIM into a modern man, not a suburban dad. Its while PUCK is dying DOGGYS hair in the kitchen that PAMELA arrives, slightly outraged that DOGGY had PETERINE cremated, mostly because their parents gifted them with a family burial plot many years earlier. DOGGY maintains that the two of them discussed it often and cremation is what PETERINE wanted. HE adds that SHE can still be buried in that plot - in ash form. PUCK diffuses PAMELAs tension with pleasantries, and even asks how the suicide note ended up in her house, then SHE begins to wonder about that too. Watching this PETERINE, once again, is armed with brilliant zingers for each comment but they go unheard. ... PAMELA is in emotional overload. SHE has a minor car accident, but hits HER head hard on the steering wheel. This leads to: PAMELA and PETERINE - THE SISTERS SCENE Somwhat in a void or dream a shouting match ensues when PAMELA yells at PETERINE for dying. PETERINE, the older sister, is adept at skirting many issues and clearly withholding something. This leaves PAMELA in a highly agitated state. Back at the car accident, PAMELA opens her eyes and sees OFFICER YUN, who offers a kind smile. As SHE slowly regains her composure, PAMELA blurts out something incriminating - leaving OFFICER YUN stunned. ... PUCK has marriage on his mind. Now that its legal, HE makes many secret moves to prepare for his wedding to DOGGY. And a wedding means PUCK will have to introduce DOGGY to his mother - a aged Shakespearian actress - IVY HARGROVE NUBLY. Hence the name Puck. SHE arrives, and is very much an enchantress to ALL. But soon SHE lapses into her personal tragedy, and covertly blames PUCKs birth from stopping her from reaching ultimate stardom. The rift grows. ... DR. MACK TRAUT, a sensual therapist, gets DOGGY alone and sensually invites HIM to attend his Grief Group on Monday Nights. 9                                                                    DR. TRAUT I lost my Bernadette six years ago and I still feel the pain every day. DOGGY Yuck.-Imean-Oh,no. DR. TRAUT Think about it, ok? Mondays are a good night for it because it sets the tone for the rest of the week. It clears the air a little bit so you can get on with your life. Besides there will be a lot of people you already know there. You shouldnt be alone at a time like this. - You are conspicuously absent. DOGGY acts grief-stricken but HEs not. MISS TIPTANNER comes to collect DR. TRAUT and THEY leave together arm-in-arm. The minute HE is alone, DOGGY rolls his eyes. DOGGY (not happy)       Great. There go my Monday Nights. ... A DINNER GOES HORRIBLY WRONG. PUCK has cooked a huge and wonderful meal and DOGGY, IVY, VITO, AGATHA and STARLIGHT are happily seated around the table. PUCK serves, but IVY has a dark moodswing and begins to berate PUCK harshly in front of the others. Eventually AGATHA takes STARLIGHT away from the table, and things get worse. IVY spills out a lot of ugly details about PUCKS tragic past. This leaves PUCK exposed and vulnerable. ... After IVY leaves, PUCK has a breakdown and confesses to DOGGY. Everything that SHE said or implied was true. PUCK was very troubled once. This only brings DOGGY closer.                   PUCK I guess youll never marry me now. DOGGY Probably not. But thats only because I hate asparagus. 10  EPISODE #5. PUCK somehow acquires another child, this time its an infant boy named WILLARD. Everyone is fine with it, and PUCK is blissed-out like a new mother. HE is very good with babies. HIS life is flourishing. ... DOGGY attends a grief counseling group with DR. TRAUT, and again performs brilliantly and believably - however, THE GHOSTS OF EACH STORY shows up behind the actual people in the group. PETERINE is also there, pacing and thinking. DOGGY doesnt see them, but HE does begin to think everyone in the session killed the person theyre grieving for. The sweetest people in town have a dark side. A weird gestalt is exposed. THE GHOSTS all look at each other with friendly but annoyed disgust. On the way out of the meeting, DOGGY bumps into his old friend SMACKERS who takes a photography class in the same building. SMACKERS, usually a clown, is having a very hard time accepting PETERINES death, and was too afraid to reach out to DOGGY and the Kids. When asked, DOGGY gives SMACKERS the complete summation without holding back now. HEs living with a man now, the love of his life, and THEY two new kids in addition to the two old kids. SMACKERS is frozen with disbelief. In a rare move (to gain his allegiance) DOGGY invites SMACKERS and his wife SIMONE to dinner at their house. Still shocked, SMACKERS doesnt really answer but DOGGY takes it as a yes. DOGGY       Youll see. Itll be just like old times. DOGGY walks away, leaving SMACKERS thunderstruck. ... AT A CARNIVAL, THE NEW FAMILY OF 4 (DOGGY, PUCK, STARLIGHT and WILLARD) is out and having a wonderful time. DOGGY has to go to the mens room and peels off from the OTHERS. HE gets lost, however, and ends up in the presence of ALLONDRA THE GREAT - a psychic. ! SHE seems to know everything about HIM as well as his future. This shakes DOGGY to the bone. SHE gives him very good advice. DOGGY never mentions this to anyone, but HE starts behaving differently and PUCK notices. ALLONDRA becomes DOGGYS elusive fixation. HE thinks HE sees HER in crowds, etc. HE needs more answers. ... 11  PUCK and AGATHA go through PETERINES things and PETERINE watches in horror. THEY are deciding to give away HER best stuff. ... At a bar OFFICER YUN has a very accidental run-in with DR. TRAUT and MISS TIPTANNER and is comedically flustered by being near DR. TRAUT, who is still and calm.
